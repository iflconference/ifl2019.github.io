      <p>Welcome to the website for IFL 2019, the 31st Symposium on
      Implementation and Application of Functional Languages. The goal of the
      <a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/bin/view/IFL/WebHome">IFL symposia</a>
      is to bring together researchers actively engaged in the implementation
      and application of functional and function-based programming languages.
      IFL 2019 will be a venue for researchers to present and discuss new ideas
      and concepts, work in progress, and publication-ripe results related to
      the implementation and application of functional languages and
      function-based programming.</p>

          <h5 class="media-heading">On Functional Programming and Proving</h5>
          <p>
"Functional Programming and Proving" is the name of a 3000-level module in the major "Mathematics, Computation, and Statistics" at Yale-NUS College, which is the first college of liberal arts and sciences founded in Asia.
This module builds on the articulatedness dispensed in the core curriculum and contributes to the inter-disciplinarity of the major by connecting programming and proving using the Coq proof assistant.
It introduces the concepts of writing proofs rigorously in a domain-specific language and of reasoning about programs in this language, stating each property not just in a fleeting comment or as a show-stopping run-time assertion, but as a theorem.
Learning goals include writing programs, stating properties of these programs (including unit tests), and proving these properties (including the soundness of these unit tests).
In the course of the semester, the students firm up and unify their understanding of programming and of proving, appear secure enough in their knowledge in that they can explain what they do, and then, with a new awareness of the physicality of proofs (for the mathematically inclined) and of the logicality of programs (for the computationally inclined), they display eagerness to pursue their educational path in mathematics, computation, and statistics.
          </p>
          <p>
Against this backdrop, this talk addresses the concept of understandability in programming and in proving, namely to which extent do we understand a program and a proof, and to which extent does this understanding matter.
For example, in the early days of the programming language ML at Edinburgh, types were inferred with a theorem prover.
Today, little do we care why precisely our program has a type: what matters is that it does, so that we can move on, heedless of the uniqueness of this type.
So where do we draw the line about understanding enough and how do we construct such an understanding in a way that is sound enough?
A proof assistant such as Coq provides a remarkably firm point on which budding mathematicians and computer scientists can stand to lift their world during their formative years in college.
In this day and age where applied research is all the rage, being articulate and having a degree of fluency in both programming and proving (to say nothing of statistics) means that one knows something basic that one can then apply broadly and in a sustainable way.

Professor Olivier Danvy received his undergraduate degree (DEUG Sciences et Structures de la Matière) at the Université de Haute Normandie, in France. His alma mater (“nourishing mother”) is the Université Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris VI), where he defended a PhD (“License to conduct research”) in 1986 and a Habilitation (“License to direct research”) in 1993. He could, however, not leave well enough alone and so he defended a DSc (“Doctorate of Science”) in 2006 at Aarhus University in Denmark, making it his alma socrus (“nourishing mother-in-law”; he is also married to a Dane in real life). Prior to that, he joined Professor Neil D Jones’s research group in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen as an Inria-funded post-doctorate to study self-applicable partial evaluation and he stayed there two more years as an assistant professor. He then toured the US for four years (visiting Stanford University, Indiana University, Kansas State University, and Carnegie Mellon University, and spending a summer at Yale University, another at Xerox PARC, and a third at the Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology) before returning to Denmark and joining the Department of Computer Science at Aarhus University, where he contributed to the BRICS Center of Excellence and the BRICS PhD School for a decade. Throughout it all, he managed to supervise over 20 PhD students, totalling over 10 distinct nationalities, and due to the prolificity of these PhD students, he is now in position to hear the pitter patter of academic great-grandchildren’s feet. He positively loves to teach, and he concurs with Leo Rosten in that humour is the affectionate communication of insight and with Albus Dumbledore in that watching students grow is a joy. He also believes that if students can smile about something technical, they have already started to reflect about it.

    <h4>Clarification of IFL 2019's Submission Process
      <br />(Notice the process has changed w.r.t. previous years)</h4>

    <br>
    <p>
    IFL 2019 solicits two kinds of submissions:
    </p><ol>
      <li> <b>Regular papers</b> (12 pages including references)
      </li><li> <b>Draft papers for presentations</b> ('weak' limit between 8 and 15 pages)
      </li></ol>

      <p>
      <u>Regular papers</u> will undergo a rigorous review by the program
      committee, and will be evaluated according to their correctness,
      novelty, originality, relevance, significance, and clarity. A set of
      regular papers will be either accepted as-is or conditionally accepted for publication. Authors
      of accepted papers will be provided with committee
      reviews. Conditionally accepted papers will be accompanied by a set of mandatory revisions.
      Regular papers not accepted for publication may be considered as draft papers, at the
      request of the author.
      </p>

      <p>
      <u>Draft papers</u> will be screened to make sure that they are within the
      scope of IFL, and will be accepted for presentation or rejected
      accordingly.
      </p>

      <h5>Prior to the symposium:</h5>
      <p>
      <u>Authors of (conditionally) accepted papers and accepted presentations</u> will
      submit a pre-proceedings version of their work that will appear in the draft
      proceedings distributed at the symposium. The draft proceedings does not
      constitute a formal publication.

      We require that at least one of the authors present the work at IFL 2019. <br>
      </p>

      <h5>After the symposium:</h5>

      <u>Authors of conditionally accepted papers</u> will submit a revised versions of
      their paper for the formal post-proceedings.
      The program committee will assess whether the mandatory revisions have been
      adequately addressed by the authors and thereby determines the final
      accept/reject status of the paper.
      <br>

      <i>Our interest is to ultimately accept all conditionally accepted papers. If you are an author of a conditionally accepted paper, please make sure that you address all the concerns of the reviewers. </i>

      <p>
      <u>Authors of accepted draft papers</u> for presentation will be given the opportunity to incorporate
      the feedback from discussions at the symposium and will be invited to submit a
      revised full article for the formal post-proceedings.
      The program committee will evaluate these submissions according to their
      correctness, novelty, originality, relevance, significance, and clarity, and
      will thereby determine whether the paper is accepted or rejected.
      </p>
  </div>

  <p>
  At no time may work submitted to IFL be simultaneously submitted to other venues; submissions must adhere to ACM SIGPLAN's republication policy: <a href="http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication">http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication</a>
