      <p>Welcome to the website for IFL 2019, the 31st Symposium on
      Implementation and Application of Functional Languages. The goal of the
      <a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/bin/view/IFL/WebHome">IFL symposia</a>
      is to bring together researchers actively engaged in the implementation
      and application of functional and function-based programming languages.
      IFL 2019 will be a venue for researchers to present and discuss new ideas
      and concepts, work in progress, and publication-ripe results related to
      the implementation and application of functional languages and
      function-based programming.</p>

          <h5 class="media-heading">On Functional Programming and Proving</h5>
          <p>
"Functional Programming and Proving" is the name of a 3000-level module in the
major "Mathematics, Computation, and Statistics" at Yale-NUS College, which is
the first college of liberal arts and sciences founded in Asia. This module
builds on the articulatedness dispensed in the core curriculum and contributes
to the inter-disciplinarity of the major by connecting programming and proving
using the Coq proof assistant. It introduces the concepts of writing proofs
rigorously in a domain-specific language and of reasoning about programs in
this language, stating each property not just in a fleeting comment or as a
show-stopping run-time assertion, but as a theorem. Learning goals include
writing programs, stating properties of these programs (including unit tests),
and proving these properties (including the soundness of these unit tests). In
the course of the semester, the students firm up and unify their understanding
of programming and of proving, appear secure enough in their knowledge in that
they can explain what they do, and then, with a new awareness of the
physicality of proofs (for the mathematically inclined) and of the logicality
of programs (for the computationally inclined), they display eagerness to
pursue their educational path in mathematics, computation, and statistics.
          </p>
          <p>
Against this backdrop, this talk addresses the concept of understandability in
programming and in proving, namely to which extent do we understand a program
and a proof, and to which extent does this understanding matter. For example,
in the early days of the programming language ML at Edinburgh, types were
inferred with a theorem prover. Today, little do we care why precisely our
program has a type: what matters is that it does, so that we can move on,
heedless of the uniqueness of this type. So where do we draw the line about
understanding enough and how do we construct such an understanding in a way
that is sound enough? A proof assistant such as Coq provides a remarkably firm
point on which budding mathematicians and computer scientists can stand to lift
their world during their formative years in college. In this day and age where
applied research is all the rage, being articulate and having a degree of
fluency in both programming and proving (to say nothing of statistics) means
that one knows something basic that one can then apply broadly and in a
sustainable way.

Olivier Danvy is currently a professor in the Science Division of Yale-NUS
College and a honorary professor in the Department of Computer Science at
Aarhus University. He is interested in all aspects of programming languages,
from their logic and semantics to their implementation, including programming,
transforming programs, program transformations, and reasoning about programs
and about program transformations (for after all one man's program is another
program's data). In his spare time, he wonders about Platonism: do we invent,
e.g., programs, program transformers, abstract machines, and control operators,
or do we discover them? Less seriously, he also hopes to formalize, one day,
the chicken-and-egg problem in Coq.

    <h4>Clarification of IFL 2019's Submission Process
      <br />(Notice the process has changed w.r.t. previous years)</h4>

    <p>
    IFL 2019 solicits two kinds of submissions:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Draft papers for presentations</b> ('weak' limit between 8 and 15 pages)
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Regular papers</b> (12 pages including references)
      </li>
    </ol>

      <h5>Prior to the symposium:</h5>
      <p>
      <b>Draft papers</b> will be screened to make sure that they are within
      the scope of IFL, and will be accepted for presentation or rejected
      accordingly.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Regular papers</b> will undergo a rigorous review by the program
      committee, and will be evaluated according to their correctness, novelty,
      originality, relevance, significance, and clarity. These papers will
      receive one of five verdicts:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><i>Accept in its current form:</i>
The paper is accepted for publication and is ready for publication in its
current form. Authors are encouraged to consider the reviewers' feedback, but
are not obliged to make modifications to the paper to accommodate it.
        </li>

        <li>
          <i>Accept with minor revisions:</i>
The paper is accepted for publication. Authors must do their best to address
the reviewers' feedback. The authors' best judgement will be used to interpret
how best to integrate the feedback in the paper. If (and only if) it is clear
that the authors chose to ignore the majority of the feedback without providing
a reasonable rationale for doing so, the paper will be demoted to "Accept with
major revisions" status and be assigned a shepherd.
        </li>

        <li>
          <i>Accept with major revisions:</i>
The paper may be accepted for publication, provided the paper undergoes major
revisions and addresses most of the reviewers' feedback. A PC member is
assigned to the paper to shepherd the submission. The shepherd will decide
whether the paper has been improved sufficiently to be ready for publication.
        </li>

        <li>
          <i>Accept as draft:</i>
The paper will not be accepted for publication at this time, but the contents
are clearly relevant to the conference. Authors are encouraged to re-submit the
paper as a draft paper and present it at the conference.
        </li>

        <li>
        <i>Reject:</i>
The paper is not relevant to the conference and will be considered neither for
publication nor presentation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5>After the symposium:</h5>

      <p>
Papers accepted in their current form and those that are accepted with minor
revisions will be checked to see if they are fit for publication. For papers
with minor revisions this includes a check to determine whether revisions have
been made. This is a light-weight process and does not involve a second formal
review round.
      </p>

      <p>
Papers with major revisions will get published if and only if the shepherd is
satisfied with the modifications.
      </p>

      <p>
Draft papers (both draft submissions and full papers with a draft accept
status) go through a formal review round. These papers can get any of the
following statuses, of which the definition has been provided above:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Accept in its current form</li>
        <li>Accept with minor revisions</li>
        <li>Accept with major revisions</li>
        <li>Reject</li>
      </ul>

  </div>

  <p>
  At no time may work submitted to IFL be simultaneously submitted to other
  venues; submissions must adhere to ACM SIGPLAN's republication policy:

  <h4>Transportation</h4>
  <p>
  For participants staying at the Park Rochester hotel, the hotel is generously
  providing a shuttle bus service to the conference. On the first day, this
  shuttle bus will leave at 8am from the hotel. On the other two days, the bus
  will leave at 9am.
  </p>

  <p>
  Taxis and ride-share options are widely available in Singapore. The
  ComfortDelGro app can be used to book a taxi, while Grab and Gojek can be used
  for ride-sharing. Uber is not available in Singapore. These apps are somtimes
  aware of the exact building where the conference is being held (COM 2).
  Alternatively, they accept the address as destination: 15 Computing Dr,
  Singapore 117418. Booking rides through the various apps allows payment with
  credit card. Taxis in particular also accept cash. Some taxis in Singapore
  <i>only</i> accept cash, so it is recommended to always bring some cash along.
  </p>

  <p>
  Suggestions for public transportation can be provided by apps such as Google
  Maps or Citymapper. To use public transportation, purchasing an MRT card is
  required. This can typically be done at the airport or the bigger MRT
  stations.
  </p>

  <h4>Connectivity</h4>
  <p>
  Pre-paid SIM cards are widely available at the airport and in town. Should you
  not wish to purchase a local SIM card, Singapore is covered by plenty of free
  hotspots, such as Wireless@SG.
  </p>

  <p>
  The NUS campus has Eduroam coverage for those with an Eduroam account. For
  participants who don't have an Eduroam account, wireless network details will
  be made available during the conference.
